# distance_matrix
This function will generate a distance matrix for a set of points on the cartesian plane

The function takes an input n. It generates n random points on a cartesian plane and return the coordinates and a distance matrix which has the pairwise Euclidean distance for all points in a nxn matrix.

This distance matrix is particularly useful for testing Vehicle Routing Problem or Traveling Salesperson Problem in supply chain.
